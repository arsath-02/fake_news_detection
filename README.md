# Deep Learning Models for Textual Data

This repository contains implementations of various deep learning models for text processing tasks, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Bidirectional GRU (BiGRU), and BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers).

## Models Included:

### 1. LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
- **Description**: LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture designed to handle the vanishing gradient problem in traditional RNNs. It can capture long-range dependencies in sequential data, making it suitable for tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, and sequence prediction.
- **Usage**: The LSTM model implementation can be found in the `lstm_model.py` file.

### 2. BiLSTM (Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory)
- **Description**: BiLSTM extends LSTM by processing input sequences in both forward and backward directions. This allows the model to capture contextual information from both past and future states, improving its ability to understand the semantics of the input sequence.
- **Usage**: The BiLSTM model implementation is available in the `bilstm_model.py` file.

### 3. GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)
- **Description**: GRU is another variant of the traditional RNN architecture that addresses the vanishing gradient problem. It combines the gating mechanisms of LSTM with a simplified architecture, resulting in fewer parameters and faster training times while retaining similar performance.
- **Usage**: The GRU model implementation can be found in the `gru_model.py` file.

### 4. BiGRU (Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit)
- **Description**: BiGRU extends GRU by processing input sequences in both forward and backward directions, similar to BiLSTM. This enables the model to capture bidirectional context information, enhancing its understanding of the input sequence.
- **Usage**: The BiGRU model implementation is provided in the `bigru_model.py` file.

### 5. BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
- **Description**: BERT is a transformer-based model pre-trained on large corpora of text data using masked language modeling and next sentence prediction objectives. It has revolutionized natural language processing tasks by capturing deep contextual representations of words and sentences.
- **Usage**: The BERT model implementation can be found in the `bert_model.py` file. This implementation utilizes the Hugging Face Transformers library for easy integration and fine-tuning.
